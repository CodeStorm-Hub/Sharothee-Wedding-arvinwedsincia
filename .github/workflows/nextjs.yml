# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
# NOTE: This workflow is currently NOT FUNCTIONAL for this project because:
# - Static export (output: 'export') is disabled due to NextAuth incompatibility
# - The application requires server-side functionality (API routes, authentication)
# - For production deployment, use Hostinger VPS deployment instead
# - See HOSTINGER_VPS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md and ci-cd-pipeline.yml for proper deployment
