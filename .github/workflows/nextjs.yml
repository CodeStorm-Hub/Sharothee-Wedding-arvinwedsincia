# Workflow for building and deploying a static Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# NOTE: This workflow builds a static-only version of the site without:
# - API routes (forms will show email contact information instead)
# - Admin pages (authentication requires server-side functionality)
# - For full-featured deployment with backend, use Hostinger VPS deployment
# - See HOSTINGER_VPS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md and ci-cd-pipeline.yml for server deployment
